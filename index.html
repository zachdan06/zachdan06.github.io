<center><h2 style="color:white;">What is a Black Hole?</h2></center>

<p style="color:white;">A black hole is an extremely dense object that has such a high force of gravity, to the point that no light or even electromagnetic radiation can escape from it. This makes them insanely large holes in the universe which practically nothing can escape from. Our knowledge of black holes is still quite limited since the closest black hole to earth is still insanely far away.  </p>

<p style="color:white;">The idea of a black hole or anything like one, was first proposed in 1784 by John Michelle. At this time he called black holes “Dark stars”</p>

style="color:white;"> As science continued to advance and more discoveries were made, more people started to believe John Michelles idea of a “Dark star.” Discoveries like Einstein's theory of relativity and discovery of an event horizon helped popularize this idea to the general public. </p>

<p style="color:white;"> Eventually the name dark star, was replaced with black hole as this idea of an object that seemingly nothing could escape from, was popularized. </p>

<h3 style="color:white;"> Black holes were confirmed to have existed in 1967, but only recently in 2020 was the first picture of a black hole ever taken. </h3>

<center><h2 style="color:white;"> What principles make a black hole work? </h2></center>

<p style="color:white;"> Many physics principles are at play when a black hole sucks objects towards it. Some of these principles include:

<ul style="list-style-type-square">
<li style="color:white;"> The Ergosphere </li>
<li style="color:white;"> Gravitational Singularity </li>
<li style="color:white;"> The Event Horizon </li>
<li style="color:white;"> The Photon Sphere </li>

</ul>

<center><h1 style=color:white;>The Ergosphere</h1></center>

<p style="color:white;">Ergospheres are found surrounding rotating black holes, it is considered a certain part of spacetime where it is impossible to stand. The ergosphere is said to be so strong that you would need to go at the speed of light backwards just to stay still.  </p>

<p style="color:white;"> An interesting property about the Ergosphere is that some objects can enter the Ergosphere, and then leave it with more energy than they enter with thanks to the "Penrose process." The energy is said to be gained from the rotational energy of the black hole.
</p>
<p style="color:white;"> This area is before the event horizon, but the black hole still has the ability to suck things closer to it at this distance. It is said that light can escape from the Ergosphere on rare occasions. </p>

<p style="color:white;"> The Ergosphere is the part of a black hole that is farthest away from the center of the black hole. </p>

<p style="color:white;"> The green portion of this diagram shows the size and general location of the ergosphere in relation to a black hole. </p>

<center><h1 style=color:white;">Gravitational Singularity</h1></center>

<p style="color:white;"> Gravitational singularity is said to be the point in a black hole which spacetime curvature becomes infinite. For some black holes this will be a center point and for others it will take the shape of a ring. </p>

<p style="color:white;"> It is said that after passing the event horizon, that object would inevitably be carried to the gravitational singularity which would then crush it to an "infinite density" as its mass would be added to the black hole. This is of course not before being torn apart completely by tidal forces (The force that strains two objects when one of them has a much larger mass than the other) in a rather scary fashion. This is how a black hole grows bigger, by absorbing more mass from things around it. </p>

<center><h1 style=color:white;>The Event Horizion</h1></center>

<p style="color:white;"> An event horizon is a certain part around the black hole, where after something enters through it, it can not come back. This includes light itself.
</p>
<p style="color:white;"> This term was coined as “event horizon” because if something occurs in the boundary of the event horizon, then whatever happens in that boundary would never be known to an outside observer since it would never be able to leave the event horizon and nothing else would ever be known about it.
 </p>
<p style="color:white;"> Another major occurrence in the event horizon is gravitational time dilation. This means for any object in a black hole, all of its processes slow down and it's almost like time itself has been slowed down, along with this, something called gravitational redshift would occur. This would dim the light of everything in the event horizon and slightly shift its color red. If you were the one falling into the event horizon, it would seem like time is happening as normal but, if you were the observer, you would be able to see everything slow down and shift color.

 <p style="color:white;"> Scientists have found a way to measure the radius of the event horizon by using the equation:</p>
 
 <center><img src="https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8ab9f825658da88763d83620cdbf77ef"width="280" height="260"></center>
 
 <p style="color:white;"> R = radius of the event horizon or Schwarzschild radius </p>
 <p style="color:white;"> G = Gravitational constant</p>
 <p style="color:white;"> M = Mass of the black hole</p>
 <p style="color:white;"> c = speed of light </p>

<hr width="120%" color="white" size="5px" />

<center><h1 style=color:white;>The Photon Sphere</h1></center>

<p style="color:white;">The photon sphere is a certain distance away from the black whole where gravity gets strong enough that photons (The particles that make up light) start to get stuck in a circular orbit. In simpler terms, this means that light itself would start to orbit around a black hole, untill the light finally falls deeper into the black hole </p>

<p style="color:white;"> It is said that light can escape from the photon sphere. It is farther away from the black hole than the event horizon, but not as far away as the ergosphere.
 </p>
 
 <p style="color:white;"> Another strange property of the photon sphere is that in the photon sphere, centrifugal force drops to nothing. This means that you would always weigh the same in the Photon Sphere, and your weight wouldn’t be based off of your orbiting speed, like it usually is. 
 </p>
 <p style="color:white;"> A rotating black hole (A special kind of black hole that can gain momentum) would have two different photon spheres. One Photon Sphere would be moving alongside the black hole while the other would be moving against it. 
 </p>

<p style="color:white;"> The equation to calculate the radius of the Photon Sphere, is very similar to how you calculate the radius of the event horizon. The equation is:</p>

<p style="color:white;"> r = 3GM/c^2

<p style="color:white;"> Just like in the equation for the Event Horizon:</p>

<p style="color:white;"> R = radius of the event horizon or Schwarzschild radius </p>
 <p style="color:white;"> G = Gravitational constant</p>
 <p style="color:white;"> M = Mass of the black hole</p>
 <p style="color:white;"> c = speed of light </p>
